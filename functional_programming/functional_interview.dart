  What is Functional Programming?

  We have some paradigms in programming languaces such as:
    * Imperative Programming
        -OOP
        -Procedural Programming
        -Structural Programming
        
    * Declarative Programming
        -FunctionalProgramming
        -LogicProgramming


  Imperative Programming: Comprises a sequence of commands imperatives => "How"

    -Commands manipulate state of system and variables.
    -Many side effects
    -Mutable Variables
    -Control Flow

  Declarative Programming: Declare what results we want and leave 
                           the programming language to Figure out how to 
                           produce them. =>"What"
    
    -What not how
    -Language can figure out how when you tell it what
    -No side Effects
    -No mutable variables
    -Express data flow
